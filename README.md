Within these folders users can find raw image files (in .lsm format), CellProfiler pipeline project and pipeline files, ImageJ Macros and an example analysed dataset, which contains raw output data (.csv files), segmentation output images (.tiff files) and an annotated dataset (.xlsx file) which highlights which columns will be useful to users for downstream analysis applications
